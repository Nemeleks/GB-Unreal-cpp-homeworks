At the church, or registry office, the bride and groom exchange rings before walking together back down the aisle. 
When they get outside, the bride throws her bouquet in the air. 
Tradition says that whoever catches it will be the next person to get married.

But itâ€™s not only the bride who throws something. All the people at the wedding throw confetti and rice over the happy couple.

Finally, after the reception, the bride and groom drive off to have their honeymoon.
